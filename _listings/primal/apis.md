  description: Primal is a cloud-based data service (DaaS) that filters and organizes
    Web content based on the interests of individual end users. Primal&#039;s RESTful
    API allows developers create expansive semantic networks representing the interests
    of end-users. These interest networks can be used to personalize your products
    and services. The service can connect to any publicly accessible sources of content
    on the Web, delivering information that&#039;s precisely filtered according to
    the interests of your end-users. Each call to the API is formated as a simple
    URL that describes a topic. The data response presents a hierarchy of related
    topics that describe the interest to a high level of fidelity. The data response
    also includes content abstracts that are tagged with the topics of interest. Primal&#039;s
    underlying AI includes a learning mechanism that acquires and refines this interest
    data over time, making the ongoing operation and maintenance of the data seamless
    and painless.
