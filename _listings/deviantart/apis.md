  description: There are two ways for applications and websites to integrate with
    deviantART. The oEmbed API, which allows to display content from deviantART, and
    the Sta.sh API, enabling submission of creative content to deviantART from any
    source. We have designed our APIs to use open standards, allowing developers to
    leverage off-the-shelf libraries. We aim to provide APIs that are as simple as
    possible and still open the door to great possibilities for your applications
    and websites.
